# NestJS Backend Workshop Series

Welcome to the **NestJS Backend Workshop Series**!

This workshop series is designed to guide you step by step in building **modern, scalable, and maintainable backend applications** using the progressive **NestJS framework** on Node.js.

NestJS provides a superb structure, heavily inspired by Angular, for building server-side applications that are efficient and easy to test.

By the end of this series, you will understand how to:

- Build a NestJS project and understand its core architecture (Modules, Controllers, Providers).
    
- Implement robust routing and handle HTTP requests.
    
- Manage user input using **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** and validation.
    
- Connect applications to databases using an **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapper).
    
- Implement **Authentication** (JWT/Sessions) and **Authorization** (Guards).
    
- Utilize advanced features like **Pipes** and **Interceptors**.
    
- Handle configuration and file uploads.

## 📚 Prerequisites

Before diving into this workshop, you should have a solid foundation in **Node.js, TypeScript, and database concepts**.

We highly recommend completing the following courses/resources first:

- **Node.js Programming** 👉 **[Node.js Course](https://github.com/Bayt-al-Hikmah/Nodejs)** Gain the necessary runtime environment foundation to work with NestJS.
    
- **TypeScript Programming** 👉 **[TypeScript Course](https://github.com/Bayt-al-Hikmah/TypeScript)** Master the language features (decorators, classes, interfaces) that make NestJS powerful.
    
- **SQL and Databases** 👉 **[SQL Course](https://github.com/Bayt-al-Hikmah/SQL)** Understand how to design schemas and manage data skills essential for backend development.
    
- **Frontend Development (for API consumers)** 👉 **[Front-End Course](https://github.com/Bayt-al-Hikmah/Front_End)** Learn how to consume the APIs you build.
